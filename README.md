# Competitive Programming â€“ Codeforces ðŸš€

This repository contains my solutions to **Codeforces** problems as part of my competitive programming journey.  
I am starting with **800-rated problems** and will gradually move to harder ones (900, 1000, and beyond).  

---

## ðŸ“‚ Structure
- Solutions are grouped by **difficulty rating**.  
- Each file is named after the **problem name**.  
- Inside each file, the **problem ID, name, link, and difficulty** are written in the comments.
